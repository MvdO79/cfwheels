# Beginner Tutorial: Hello World

### Testing Your Install

Let's make sure we're all on the same page. I'm going to assume that you've followed the [Getting Started](https://guides.cfwheels.org/docs/commandbox) guide and have CommandBox all setup. If you haven't done that, stop and read that guide get everything setup. It's okay, this web page will wait for you.

Okay, so you have CFWheels installed and can see the CFWheels "Congratulations!"\
page as shown below. That wasn't that hard now, was it?
