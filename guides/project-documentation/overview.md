# Overview

The intention of this section is to document the various pieces of the tooling that make the project function. This is not so much about the framework and using the framework as a developer but more for collaborator, contributors, and maintainers of the project.

## CFWheels Guides

The guides are hosted by [GitBooks.com](https://www.gitbook.com) and are accessible at [https://guides.cfwheels.org](https://guides.cfwheels.org) they are however driven by the [guides](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels/tree/develop/guides) folder in the
CFWheels repository on GitHub. This means that making changes to the guides can be accomplished via a Pull Request and code changes and changes to the guides can be submitted in the same PR.

### Making changes to the Guides

Start by cloning the [CFWheels](https://github.com/cfwheels/cfwheels) repository. The guides are contained in the `guides` folder of the repo. Make your proposed changes and submit a PR. Once the PR is reviewed and merged, the changes will automatically be synced up to GitBook and the changes will be live on the site.
